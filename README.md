# **KAT‚ò¢Ô∏èM**
This is a game developped in 48h (16th to 18th) for the 96h Game Jam (GMTK 2024 "Built to Scale") from the 16th Aug to the 20th
<br>Some of us could'nt afford to spend the last 48 hours on the project so we had to publish it the 18th in order to stay in the 48h limit

## üñ•Ô∏è Where to play?
You can either build the script by yourself using Unity or you can play it on itch.io

## üìö What is it about?
You are a soldier on the battlefield who got knockout during the war. When you wake up, you find yourself in a strange laboratory where a scientist decides to inject you a green liquid in your veins. You can't resist and collapse again.
This time when you wake up.. you feel... stronger..
You try to cut your ropes, in vein. But you can't get out of your mind the fact that you'll die if you don't do anything about it. Suddenly you feel your arms being lighter, your heart beating slower, your ears hearing farther.
Your body was transformed in some corrosive shape and you managed to escape. But you can't escape now you are sick! You know you'll have to find a cure for this bane and somehow manage to find out, what is this place.
